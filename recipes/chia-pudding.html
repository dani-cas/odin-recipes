    <img src="../images/chia-pudding.jpg">
    <p>Chia pudding is the perfect healthy breakfast or snack to meal prep for the week. It’s creamy, satisfying and loaded with protein, fiber and omega-3s. Vegan, gluten-free, paleo and keto.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Tablespoons <em>chia seeds</em></li>
        <li>1 cup of <em>almond milk</em></li>
        <li>1/2 Tablespoon <em>maple syrup</em>, honey or sweetener of choice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <em>vanilla extract</em>, optional</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice: fresh berries or other fruit, granola, nut butter, etc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl or mason jar, stir together chia seeds, milk, maple syrup and vanilla, if using. If you’re using a mason jar, you can put the lid on and shake the mixture to combine everything.</li>
        <li>Once the chia pudding mixture is well combined, let it sit for 5 minutes, give it another stir/shake to break up any clumps of chia seeds, cover and put the mixture in the fridge to “set" for 1-2 hours or overnight. The chia pudding should be nice and thick, not liquidy. If it's not thick enough, just add more chia seeds (about 1 Tablespoon), stir and refrigerate for another 30 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Chia pudding can be stored for up to 5-7 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
